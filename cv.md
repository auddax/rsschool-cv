## Summary

### Iâ€™m a self-taught front-end developer with a passion for both continuous learning and for personal growth. As a person who is starting out, I am constantly seeking for new ways to expand my skill set. Previously, being a teacher, I have gained a strong ability to effective communication, conflict management and planning. Right now, I am ready to start working in a company where I will have the opportunity to apply my skills and improve them.
